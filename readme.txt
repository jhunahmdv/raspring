This Project is generated by CodeRasPIde. CodeRasPIde is a Config, Generate, Deploy Tool for RasberryPI.
CodeRasPIde's > New PI4J Project creates the following
1. A Standard Java Project
2. A Lib Folder containing the pi4j-core.jar
3. A Configuration File with .picfg as Extn

Now open the picfg file and configure the Board as required.
Select the Board, Right Click - Generate Code
This would generate the Required Java Source based on PI4J based on the configuration file.
Run/Debug using LaunchPI

The PIN Diagram Color Code
- Black : Ground
- Red   : Power
- Green : Available GPIO PINs
- Yellow: GPIO PINs currently in USE

Currently this Config File is developed to support generation normal GPIO based RasberryPI Code
We will soon support Serial, LDC, Multi Mode PIN, I2C etc
.
This Project internally using PI4J Jars [www.pi4j.com] for Code Compilation, LaunchPI [http://tsvetan-stoyanov.github.io/launchpi/] for Remote Deployment from Eclipse into RasberryPI
